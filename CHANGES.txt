 TODO:
===============================================================================
- Fix: forgot to finish the 'class' -> 'mode' transition!
- Fix: Style: Magnifier icon should be positioned to relative to the thumbnail,
  not the host rect (because it will go way off the image with display: block).
- Fix: Style: Mysterious uneven spacing in the first test case...
  - Also in FF!
  -> 0 margin is OK, 1em seems even. Happens with a homogeneous series of elements, too!
- Workaround: FF: Moving off the zoom view leaves the hover state on in Firefox.
- Workaround: CH: Chrome has a bug, where scrolling the thumb out from under the
  mouse pointer (e.g using the mouse wheel -- but not the keyboard...), it will
  still think the element is being hovered, so the zoom view be flickering on
  and off, when hovering over the *old* place of the element...
- Add click event to stop zooming.
  Not so easy though, as the next event could be hover again, instantly reopening
  the zoom/pan view... Needs state management chores, and e.g. OnMouseOut, too...
- Move that freestanding event handler to the component's class scope!
- Simplify the model: maybe sometimes the internal image or the thumb can be omitted.
- Add some transparent frame (pseudo margin) to the zoomed views by default.
- Off by one error in IE11 (didn't try Edge): garbage at the top of the zoom view.
- Support height-constrained thumbnails, too!
- Support simultaneous width AND height constraints for thumbs,
  with some default autocropping/-padding.

2019/09/11

+ Better test page (better coverage, more systematic, explanations).
+ Default 1px grey border added.


2019/09/11: v0.1

+ Custom props explicitly supported for styling.
  + Now also border radius for the zoomed view.
+ Fix: Style: Regressions after migrated to web component:
  + border anomaly of inplace mode
  + magnifier icon misplacements (again)
  + leftover zeroing of host margin/padding
+ Fix: Style: Curious extra space between (around? within?) the elements.
+ Fix: Style: Border styles (i.e. the rounded corners) are not the same yet.
+ Fix: Style: missing var(thumb-w) for popup mode (misplaced zoom view).
+ Templatize/componentize!
  (e.g. https://dev.to/bennypowers/lets-build-web-components-part-1-the-standards-3e85,
  https://css-tricks.com/an-introduction-to-web-components/)
+ Get rid of the hardcoded styling.
 

2019/09/10

+ Unified DOM.
+ Fix: The magniifer is 1px more inside in normal in-place mode than in the basic!
  (The unified DOM layout fixed this.)
+ Fix that mysterious 2-3px bottom junk space in popup and inplace mode!
  - It is actually triggered by <!DOCTYPE html>! :-o If it's not there, no anomaly!
    + OK, it was the "descender gap" because of img being an inline element by default!
+ That same space makes the magnifier glass being offset in popup mode, because
  in that mode the mag. icon can't be in FIGURE, only in the main DIV, which has
  its strangely offset bottom, misplacing the magnifier icon...
