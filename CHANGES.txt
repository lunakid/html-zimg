 TODO:
===============================================================================
- Fix styling regressions after migrated to web component:
  + border anomaly of inplace mode
  + magnifier icon misplacements (again)
  + curious extra spacing between the elements
- Simplify the model: maybe sometimes the internal image or the thumb can be omitted.
- Add some transparent frame (pseudo margin) to the zoomed views!
- The border styles (i.e. the rounded corners) are not the same yet.
- Off by one error in IE11 (didn't try Edge): garbage at the top of the zoom view.

+ Unified DOM.

+ Fix: The magniifer is 1px more inside in normal in-place mode than in the basic!
  (The unified DOM layout fixed this.)

+ Fix that mysterious 2-3px bottom junk space in popup and inplace mode!
  - It is actually triggered by <!DOCTYPE html>! :-o If it's not there, no anomaly!
    + OK, it was the "descender gap" because of img being an inline element by default!
+ That same space makes the magnifier glass being offset in popup mode, because
  in that mode the mag. icon can't be in FIGURE, only in the main DIV, which has
  its strangely offset bottom, misplacing the magnifier icon...
