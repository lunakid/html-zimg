- Get rid of the hardcoded styling.
- Templatize/componentize!
  (e.g. https://dev.to/bennypowers/lets-build-web-components-part-1-the-standards-3e85)
- Fix: The magniifer is 1px more inside in normal in-place mode than in the basic!
- The border styles (i.e. the rounded corners) are not the same yet.
- Off by one error in IE11 (didn't try Edge): garbage at the top of the zoom view.

+ Fix that mysterious 2-3px bottom junk space in popup and inplace mode!
  - It is actually triggered by <!DOCTYPE html>! :-o If it's not there, no anomaly!
    + OK, it was the "descender gap" because of img being an inline element by default!
+ That same space makes the magnifier glass being offset in popup mode, because
  in that mode the mag. icon can't be in FIGURE, only in the main DIV, which has
  its strangely offset bottom, misplacing the magnifier icon...
